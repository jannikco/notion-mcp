# Notion MCP server

Verify the connected integration, then search shared notes by title for a meeting briefing.

A direct-provider MCP server with useful local execution. No PipMCP account is required for local use. Provider API access and any provider charges are your responsibility.

## Quick start

Requires Node.js22+. Clone this repository, then run:

```sh
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm test
npm start
```

The default command inspects the tools offline. Configure your own credentials in your environment:

- `NOTION_TOKEN`



Credential help: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makenotion/notion-mcp-server/main/scripts/notion-openapi.json

## Execute a real read

Replace example record IDs with records you are authorized to access.

```sh
npm start -- --call get_bot_user '{}'
```

## Use with an MCP client

Launch `node /absolute/path/notion-mcp/server.mjs` using stdio transport; pass credentials through the client environment. Stdout is reserved for JSON-RPC.

## Tools

| Tool | Effect | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| get_bot_user | Read | Read the integration’s bot user identity. |
| search_pages | Read | Search pages and data sources shared with your integration by title. |

## Concrete workflow

Verify the connected integration, then search shared notes by title for a meeting briefing.

1. get_bot_user
2. search_pages

## Optional writes

Writes are disabled by default. Set CONNECTOR_ALLOW_WRITES=true and supply `_approval: {approved:true,idempotencyKey:"unique-request-id"}` on the specific call. Do not reuse a key for a different request. Uncertain outcomes are never automatically replayed; inspect the provider before another attempt.

## Capability evidence

Local: **Tested — HTTP fixtures and real stdio tools/call**. Managed: **Documented**. Provider authentication and live operations have not been established by these fixture tests. Evidence applies per operation and execution mode; setup discovery does not imply provider execution.

## Managed production

[Activate with PipMCP](https://pipmcp.com/github/start?app=notion&integration=notion-mcp&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=github-notion-mcp&utm_content=readme) when you want the hosted service.  Local credentials are not uploaded by this code. Review provider permissions in the managed onboarding.
